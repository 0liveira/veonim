the fuzzy files git strategy is adding in files previously ignored by .ignore
extensions keep reinstalling
remove react-redux dependency when removing dedox
if open up explorer from terminal window, open up for cwd instead of bad term path
alternate TS lang serv... does it solve the broken multi-line hover info?
if all splits don't equal to 100%, force them to equal to 100 (open 3 vertical splits on 38 ultrawide)

new plugins mgmr works. extensions does not.
do we need to ensureDir exists or does downloadRepo auto create folders?

--ideas--
easymotion jump to highlighted word
buffer-search should only search in the current viewport. no scrolling pls
create fuzzy search for entire buffer, but use popup menu
terminal change title to current running process
backfill problems into quickfix list

press and hold mark ' keybind to bring up menu of current global marks
menu lists something like
a - support.ts
s - utils.ts
d - main.ts

pressing one of the keys takes you to that file
releasing mark keybind closes menu without any navigation
(think kinda like opie addon, but hold activate)
