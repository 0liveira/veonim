KARABINER: FIX SHIFT;;;;;;;
can we replace kr-el for semi maps? (since we have key down/up events)
fix rendering glitches when typing? are we rounding somwhere or losing precision in calculations?
perf improvements?

consider using canvas cursor to do better blend with vim canvas (what about cursor for inputs?)

actually - could get char from canvas at x/y (under cursor) and then render it in the cursor el but inverted (if block cursor)


-- tried, failed, gave up
preload vim with autocmd and global var - setting --cmd but not taking effect. try simple example to start nvim from node script and see if it works.
support cursor colors - almost there: issue in getting color for id (synIDattr does not return val even in nvim)
