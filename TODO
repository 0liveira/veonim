extensions keep reinstalling
  - need to check code, because download function will download to ext/repo-master, but code checks for ext/user-repo

extensions are not downloading...
  - i checked the download code with the existing version and there are no changes (current works)
  - does not work in release build
  - for some reason it works if the promise is not returned/resolved (in download.ts)
  - upgraded a bunch of packages, not fix

remove react-redux dependency when removing dedox

new plugins mgmr works. extensions does not.
do we need to ensureDir exists or does downloadRepo auto create folders?

react-tiny-virtual-list for virtual lists?

--ideas--
easymotion jump to highlighted word
buffer-search should only search in the current viewport. no scrolling pls
create fuzzy search for entire buffer, but use popup menu
terminal change title to current running process
backfill problems into quickfix list

press and hold mark ' keybind to bring up menu of current global marks
menu lists something like
a - support.ts
s - utils.ts
d - main.ts

pressing one of the keys takes you to that file
releasing mark keybind closes menu without any navigation
(think kinda like opie addon, but hold activate)
