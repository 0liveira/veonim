mode_change -> change cursor (defined via vim guicursor)
support cursor colors?

resize window
fullscreen
add window/canvas render padding

render offline/background for multi neovim instances

can we replace kr-el for semi maps? (since we have key down/up events)
fix rendering glitches when typing? are we rounding somwhere or losing precision in calculations?
perf improvements?
