remove react-redux dependency when removing dedox
react-tiny-virtual-list for virtual lists?

redo home, next, prev keybinds for explorer to not use ctrl + hjkl
figure out the focus/blur on leave/enter explorer
figure out better name for embed custom render buffers
generalize embed buffers to support any components
figure out how to swap between different embed components (get buffer name?)
can we support multiple embed components, one per each buffer instance? or shared?
check on the background of embed explorer, not sure it's the exact same bg color as vim.bg

export explorer.ts view component without Plugin wrapper (to be used in a positioned vim renderer div)

--ideas--
set process.env.XDG_CONFIG_HOME in dev to use alt vim/extensions folders when testing dev that do not conflict with release builds

constrain overlay menus to a particular window (current window)
  - i.e. show symbol/file menu on top of the current buffer window, instead of the center of the program,
    since selecting a symbol or file will make changes in the current window, not globally
start splash screen include MRU projects
easymotion jump to highlighted word
buffer-search should only search in the current viewport. no scrolling pls
create fuzzy search for entire buffer, but use popup menu
terminal change title to current running process
backfill problems into quickfix list

press and hold mark ' keybind to bring up menu of current global marks
menu lists something like
a - support.ts
s - utils.ts
d - main.ts

pressing one of the keys takes you to that file
releasing mark keybind closes menu without any navigation
(think kinda like opie addon, but hold activate)
