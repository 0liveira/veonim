add window/canvas render padding
fix error messages display scroll out of bounds 
  -> modify file -> dont save -> :q
  not getting cleared because shit is out of grid-bounds

use transform: translateZ() + will-change on cursor move (gpu)

setup electron build/package and publish to npm - have release + dev builds at the same time on machine
hot reload/plain ole' reload on change/

render offline/background for multi neovim instances

KARABINER: FIX SHIFT;;;;;;;

-- tried, failed, gave up
preload vim with autocmd and global var - setting --cmd but not taking effect. try simple example to start nvim from node script and see if it works.
support cursor colors - almost there: issue in getting color for id
