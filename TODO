-- defects
investigate rendering glitches (not only in sessions) like cursorline getting stuck last block on some lines
fix tiny rendering glitches when typing? are we rounding somwhere or losing precision in calculations?

-- todos
move all rendering logic to separate file?

create plugin reload system - require-reload the module, but reuse or regenerate dom element to hook into

setup watch/reload for faster ui iteration (tsc watch, etc.) hook into tsc-watch complete -> reload plugins

setup hyperapp ui framework
  - vla for hyperapp
  - each component in separate div

create rename current window
create fuzzy list switcher
create input for creating window
create buffer switcher
create file switcher
create directory/file browser (two modes? one for cwd and another for files)

change cwd in vim instance (set to $HOME by default?)
  - two different shortcuts. one default: create new vim instance at $HOME (with terms only?)
  - another the ctrl+t+p (like in tmux) list projects and open vim in provided working dir (term/vim split?)

load configs via FS and hot-reload on changes (5ms fs vs 75-90ms via api)
  - need another "publish" path from master-control

setup staging build
  - use codemod to remove useless code (DEV_MODE shit, console.log, bad ts exports, etc)

embed binaries in release build
  - setup electron build/package for release

redo galben.vim colorscheme in truecolor (it was good, just needs to be updated for TS and #hex ofc)
