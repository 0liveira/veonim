extensions keep reinstalling
remove react-redux dependency when removing dedox

new plugins mgmr works. extensions does not.
do we need to ensureDir exists or does downloadRepo auto create folders?

react-tiny-virtual-list for virtual lists?

--ideas--
easymotion jump to highlighted word
buffer-search should only search in the current viewport. no scrolling pls
create fuzzy search for entire buffer, but use popup menu
terminal change title to current running process
backfill problems into quickfix list

press and hold mark ' keybind to bring up menu of current global marks
menu lists something like
a - support.ts
s - utils.ts
d - main.ts

pressing one of the keys takes you to that file
releasing mark keybind closes menu without any navigation
(think kinda like opie addon, but hold activate)
