remove react-redux dependency when removing dedox
react-tiny-virtual-list for virtual lists?

export explorer.ts view component without Plugin wrapper (to be used in a positioned vim renderer div)

--ideas--
set process.env.XDG_CONFIG_HOME in dev to use alt vim/extensions folders when testing dev that do not conflict with release builds

easymotion jump to highlighted word
buffer-search should only search in the current viewport. no scrolling pls
create fuzzy search for entire buffer, but use popup menu
terminal change title to current running process
backfill problems into quickfix list

press and hold mark ' keybind to bring up menu of current global marks
menu lists something like
a - support.ts
s - utils.ts
d - main.ts

pressing one of the keys takes you to that file
releasing mark keybind closes menu without any navigation
(think kinda like opie addon, but hold activate)
